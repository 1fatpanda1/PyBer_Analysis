# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
We are using Matplotlib and pandas to help analyze the ride-sharing service results for neighborhoods that are underserved.


## Results

Using pandas we found total rides, average fare per ride, and fare per driver for Rural, Suburban, and urban areas. Rural city types have the least rides but the highest average fare per driver and overall highest average fare per ride while rural has the most rides but least average fare per ride and driver.

Given these results, we graphed the time, dates, and fares for each city type.

As seen above, Urban cities have the most success in overall fares each month while the Rural cities have the least.

## Summary

In order to help address the disparities among the city types, Pyber should consider the following:

1. Increase drivers in rural areas.
2. Consider lowering rates in rural and suburban areas to attract more customers.
3. Look to improve service quality in rural and suburban areas.
